Curated List of Tiny Linux Distributions


- [Tiny Core Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Core_Linux): The Core Project, as suggested by our name, is not a turnkey desktop distribution. Instead we deliver just the core Linux from which it is quite easy to add what you want. We offer 3 different x86 "cores" to get you started: Core, TinyCore, and our installation image, CorePlus.
- [NanoLinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanolinux): NanoLinux is an open source, free and very lightweight Linux distribution that requires only 14 MB of disk space including tiny versions of the most common desktop applications and several games.

- [Damn Small Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Small_Linux): Damn Small Linux is a computer operating system for the x86 family of personal computers. It is free and open source software under the terms of the GNU GPL and other free and open source licenses.
